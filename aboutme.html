                            <h2>About Me</h2>
                          <p>
                            I’m Shubham Metha. I share a passion of learning new things in life and adapt myself to the changing 
                            situations, to seek better opportunities for professional development and personal growth. I have a 2 years’ 
                            experience as a Software Engineer at Cognizant Technology Solutions where I worked in 2 projects. In the 1st 
                            project I worked as a Database Engineer with PL-SQL and DB servers, while in 2nd project I worked with 
                            front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I’m a confident and self-motivated individual, seeking 
                            to widen the horizons of my thought process with more knowledge and academic learning, with proper planning 
                             and discipline. I try to deliver my best in everything I do.
